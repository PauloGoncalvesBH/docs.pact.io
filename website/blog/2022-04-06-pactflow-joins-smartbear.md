Today, Beth, Ron and I have some exciting news to share with you. Pactflow has been acquired by SmartBear, a leading provider of software development and quality tools. We will join their API Developer Platform, helping to solve the complex challenges of testing microservices and API integrations that companies are facing as they accelerate cloud-native application development and digital initiatives.

We care so much for OSS and are so pleased that SmartBear has a strong and demonstrated commitment to OSS—as proven through the support and scale of Cucumber and Swagger. Through our partnership, we will be able to take contract testing to new heights and help deliver key milestones in Pact’s OSS roadmap.

We wanted to take the opportunity to thank you for your dedication and support. Pactflow is not just the product built by our immediate team, but a community of individuals who’ve brought us to this point today. We’ve shared many milestones together and we look forward to sharing many more.
